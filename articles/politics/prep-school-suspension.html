					<li>
						St. Ignatius College Preperatory in San Francisco, CA, has suspended 14 
						students.
					<li>
						They were wearing clothes meant to mimic urban black culture at a party.
					</li>
					<li>
						The alleged theme of the party was "wigger."
					</li>
					<li>
						The president of the high school sent their parents a letter
						informing them that the party had "racial overtones and racist implications."
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>It is incredibly sad that this type of thing exists not just for St.
						Ignatius, but for the entire city.</i> - Patrick Ruff, principal of St.
						Ignatius College Preperatory.
					</li>
					<li>
						The party was not organized by students of St. Ignatius.
					</li>
