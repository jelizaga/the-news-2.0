						measure symptoms of depression.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first study included 88 college students as participants.
						<ul class="sub-content">
							<li>
								A correlation was found between positive 
								fantasies about the future and lower their symptoms of depression 
								in the present, but greater symptoms of depression recorded 
								6 months later.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The second study included 109 5th grade children as participants.
						<ul class="sub-content">
							<li>
								A correlation was found between positive 
								fantasies about the future and lower their symptoms of depression 
								in the present, but greater symptoms of depression recorded 
								7 months later.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						The third study included 78 college students as participants.
						<ul class="sub-content">
							<li>

								fantasies about the future and lower their symptoms of depression

					</li>
					<li>
						The fourth study included 148 college students.
						<ul class="sub-content">

							Inducing positive fantasies may indeed produce depressive symptoms by
							encouraging people to enjoy their success prematurely in their minds,
							thus lowering energy and effort.
