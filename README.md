# the-news-2.0
This is a semi-functioning prototype of a news website developed for INFO 360, a design class
in the Informatics major at the University of Washington.

The premise of this prototype is a news outlet with de-sensationalized and un-inflammatory
articles algorithmically written by a contingent of bots and web-crawlers. These bots and
crawlers aggregate content across the webs' numerous news sites and blogs, and use the 
collected data to compose short, simple news articles with indisputable facts and
uncontestible updates. These articles are free of adjectives and appeals to emotion,
allowing the audience to formulate their own reactions without the visceral, click-bait
headlines that seek to twist their perspective for them.

The goal of such a project is to develop an informed audience who won't have to stress
over over-blown epidemics, disposable pseudo-news and shocking celebrity scandals. Our
audience won't even have to worry about the validity of what they read, as sources will
always be cited at the bottom of each article.

As this is a prototype, all articles are hard-coded into the website using html. This could
feasibly be changed in the future.
