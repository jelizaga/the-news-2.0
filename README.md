# the-news-2.0
## Summary
This is a semi-functioning prototype of a news website developed for INFO 360, a design class
in the Informatics major at the University of Washington.

This prototype is a news outlet with de-sensationalized and un-inflammatory
articles algorithmically written by a contingent of bots and web-crawlers. These bots and
crawlers aggregate content across the webs' numerous news sites and blogs, and use the 
collected data to compose concise news articles with indisputable facts and
uncontestible updates. These articles are free of adjectives and appeals to emotion,
allowing the audience to formulate their own reactions and opinions without the visceral,
click-bait headlines that seek to twist their perspective for them.

The goal of such a project is to cultivate an informed audience who won't have to pull their
hair out over over-blown epidemics, disposable pseudo-news, shocking celebrity scandals
and other veritable dumpster-fires of trite bullshit. Our audience won't even have to worry about 
the validity of what they read, as sources will always be cited at the bottom of each article.

As this is a prototype, all articles are hard-coded into the website using html. This could
feasibly be changed in the future.

## Features
- A responsive interface optimized for every monitor of every conceivably realistic size.
- An unobtrusive design befitting of our unobtrusive content.
- *Purely information-based content for a healthier nation, homediggle!*
